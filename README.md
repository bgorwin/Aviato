# Jobiato

What is Jobiato?
Jobiato is a job search application that allows a user to search for a job position using Indeed API.


Why is it different?
Jobiato is different because it allows the user to search for a job as well as see what Meetup's are coming up for that specific job search. It provides the user with the ability to see both a job posting/Meetup all on the same application.

Details in building this application:
1. Google Firebase Database
2. Google Signin User Authentication
3. Meetup's API
4. Indeed API
5. Bootstrap Design
6. JavaScript, HTML, CSS.
